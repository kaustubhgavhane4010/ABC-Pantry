# Business Case: ABC Company is the world’s leading online e-commerce company. They started by selling books and now have a presence across the world selling more than 6 million items globally. Most of the products that dominate ABC Company’s sales are non-essential products like fashion products, electronic gadgets, mobile phones, beauty products, books and home furnishings. But ABC Company has realized that every household will need daily essential products like cereals, snacks, beverages, cleaning products, grooming products and so on. ABC Company is seeing a huge market globally in Daily Essential Products and wants to venture into this side of business. ABC Company decided to create a new feature known as ABC Pantry which would sell daily essential products. This would be an additional enhancement in the current website/app. This would be ABC Company’s foray into daily essential products which are regular consumption products and would lead to repeat sales every month.
